## Instructions for Self Test with Postman

* Have node.js and Mongo installed
* Download zip and unpack
* Open command prompt
* navigate to `salu-pro-test-master`
* run `npm install -g node-modules` to get the node modules or `yarn install` if yarn is installed
* `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js` to start the server (if yarn was used to install dependencies)

* From there, Postman can be used to test the functions 
* keys for document entry into database are first, last, phone, email, and address.
